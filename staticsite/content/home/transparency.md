We care deeply about transparency. All of our mailing list archives are public.
While we do not share the members of the mailing list publicly, the current count of  members on the mailing list are XXX, compared to the number of UE signatures (YYY).

We also care about visitor's privacy, and do not load any resources external to this domain. Our aggregate webserver traffic information is also public and accessible here.
