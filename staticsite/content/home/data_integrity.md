### UE Policy and Practices 
- We reference the 2019 version of the UE National Constitution which was graciously provided to us by our local UE reps. We have rehosted [the file](/2019_Constitution.pdf) on this site for convenience as it is not clearly available on either the [UE](https://www.ueunion.org) or [GSU](https://www.mitgsu.org) website.
- Whenever we reference UE and GSU policies (or lack thereof) we draw these references from their respective websites.
- When calculating the expected dues, we reference both the UE National Constitution and conversations with GSU reps. The national constitution requires a rate of 1.65 hours of pay per month per worker to go to national. Additionally, GSU reps have quoted a figure of “1.44%” of a worker's annual salary as the total annual dues (which include dues to the national and the local).  

### Financial
- When we make claims about the financial status or operations of the UE, we reference their filings with the US Department of Labor. These data can be independently obtained from the [Office of Labor-Management Standards](https://olmsapps.dol.gov/olpdr/).
- The most recently available data from the Deparment of Labor are from 2018. We reference these as "current" finances despite them being 3 years old as no other data is available.
