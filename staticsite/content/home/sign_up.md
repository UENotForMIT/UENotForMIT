####  Mailing List Privacy
We use MIT certificates to easily validate your identity and automatically add/remove you to the relevant mailing lists.
Importantly, our webserver *independently* validates your certificate without contacting MIT servers. However, your Kerberos
does need to be sent to the mailing list servers.

#### Transparency

**We care deeply about transparency.** All of our mailing list archives are public.

We also care about visitor's privacy, and do not load any resources external to this domain. Our aggregate webserver traffic information is also public and accessible [here](https://plausible.uenotformit.org/uenotformit.org). We also have a web archive of the [relevant unionization websites](https://archive.uenotformit.org).
