#### Beck Objection
The right to object to contributing to political speech is protected under the First Amendment. Under the Beck Objection 
you are required to pay fees associated with the cost of the union representing you in bargaining (about 61% of total dues), 
but you are exempt from paying the portion of union dues which goes to political activity (about 39% of the total dues). 

While UE makes no donations to political campaigns, UE and GSU employees are heavily involved in political activity, 
UE runs a news organ which is heavily political, and the UE conference/summit makes many political statements. 

Note: Members who exercise their Beck rights are not considered members in good standing and are disqualified from voting in union elections.   

**How to:**
Send a paper letter to the secretary treasurer of UE. In the letter, state that you wish to exercise your Beck objection 
rights. Make sure to include your name, street address, MIT student ID number, email address, and the chapter number 
of GSU (MIT-GSU, UE local #256). Address the letter to:

Andrew Dinkelaker\
UE General Secretary-Treasurer\
United Electrical Workers (UE)\
4 Smithfield St, 9th Floor\
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

Email an electronic copy of the letter to MIT’s administration at the address gradunionquestions@mit.edu and cc Ellen McClintock 
ellenmcc@mit.edu. In the email, state that you wish to exercise your Beck objection right and that you had already sent the attached 
letter to UE. Request that they halt any paycheck deductions until you set up a procedure to pay only the reduced representation fees. 

Email an electronic copy of your letter to GSU at contact@mitgsu.org to notify them of your Beck objection.

If UE or GSU deny your Beck objection as they have done to other members, this is a violation of your civil rights under the first 
amendment and you may press charges through the NLRB.

**Note that your paid fees should be equal to 61.2% of dues** (0.88% salary), calculated as 79.0% of national dues, 
93.6% of regional dues, and 0.0% of local dues.

If you are told to pay a number equal to 84.4% of dues (1.22% salary), this is a factual misrepresentation by the UE, illegally requiring you to pay 100% of local dues instead of 0%. You should request documentation to support this number (which will correctly list 0% of local dues, while containing a mathematical error concluding 84.4% of total dues), and submit that documentation, including a note about the UE's misrepresentation of the math to both gradunionquestions@mit.edu and contact@mitgsu.org.


#### Religious Objection
If paying money in any amount to the UE is a violation of your sincerely held religious beliefs, you 
are eligible to request a religious objection, in which case you must pay an amount equal to (full) 
dues to a non-religious charity in lieu of any dues or fees payment to the UE.

Note: Members who object on religious grounds are not considered members in good standing 
and are disqualified from voting in union elections.

**How to:**
Send a paper letter to the secretary treasurer of UE. In the letter, state that your religious beliefs 
prevent you from contributing in any way to the UE. Make sure to include your name, street address, 
MIT student ID number, email address, and the chapter number of GSU (MIT-GSU, UE local #256). 
You should also explain why your sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit you from contributing 
to the UE.  Address the letter to:

Andrew Dinkelaker\
UE General Secretary-Treasurer\
United Electrical Workers (UE)\
4 Smithfield St, 9th Floor\
Pittsburgh, PA 15222

Email an electronic copy of the letter to MIT’s administration at the address gradunionquestions@mit.edu
and cc Ellen McClintock ellenmcc@mit.edu. In the email, state that you wish to object on religious grounds 
and that you had already sent the attached letter to UE. Request that they halt any paycheck deductions 
and provide instructions as to the amount and required documentation for your donations to charity. 

Email an electronic copy of your letter to GSU at contact@mitgsu.org to notify them of your religious objection.

If UE or GSU deny your religious objection as they have done to other members, this is a violation of 
your civil rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and you may press charges through the NLRB.
