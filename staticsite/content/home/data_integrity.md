### UE Policy and Practices 
- We reference the 2019 version of the UE National Constitution which was graciously provided to us by our local UE reps. We have rehosted [the file](/2019_Constitution.pdf) on this site for convenience as it is not clearly available on either the [UE](https://www.ueunion.org) or [GSU](https://www.mitgsu.org) website.
- Whenever we reference UE and GSU policies (or lack thereof) we draw these references from their respective websites.
- When calculating the expected dues, we reference both the UE National Constitution for the rate at which money must go to national (1.65 hours of pay per worker per month) as well as a "1.44%" total (local + national) figure which has been provided to us numerous times by GSU reps. This number does not appear directly in the constitution. Instead, the constitution reports a minimum local contribution of $10 per worker per month. When comparing the "1.44%" to the 1.65 hours of pay, one finds that $15 will go to the local union per worker per month. 

### Financial
- When we make claims about the financial status or operations of the UE, we reference their filings with the US Department of Labor. These data can be independently obtained from the [Office of Labor-Management Standards](https://olmsapps.dol.gov/olpdr/).
- The most recently available data from the Deparment of Labor are from 2018. We reference these as "current" finances despite them being 3 years old as no other data is available.
