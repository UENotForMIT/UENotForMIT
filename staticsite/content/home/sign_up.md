#### Available mailing lists
You can signup and remove yourself from the following mailing lists:
- Announcement mailing list.
- Discussion mailing list, for any unionization effort discussion.
- Contributor mailing list, for adding information to this website!
- Independent union organization mailing list.

at any time by visiting the signup page [domain.org/signup (MIT certificate required)](https://domain.org/signup).

####  Mailing list privacy
We use MIT certificates to easily validate your identity and automatically add/remove you to the relevant mailing lists.
Importantly, our webserver *independently* validates your certificate without contacting MIT servers. However, your Kerberos
does need to be sent to the mailing list servers.
