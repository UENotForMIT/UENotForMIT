#### Financial concerns
The primary reasons given for aligning with the UE as a national union are financial. 
Creating a union has start-up costs such as legal defense for the right to unionize, legal counsel for initial contract bargaining and constitutional drafting, and experienced volunteers to aid in the organizing process.   

While these costs do exist, we do not need to align with the UE (or any other national) to cover them.  

##### The Financial Value of UE
As a UE local, we would pay a total of 1.44% of our salary in annual dues.
Assuming 2000 work-hours per year at $20/hour, this comes to $576 per person, per year.
Of this 1.65 hours per person per month go to the UE national, coming to $398 per person, per year ($178 stays in the local).
There are approximately [7000](https://web.mit.edu/facts/enrollment.html) graduate students at MIT, while not all are eligible to unionize (by virtue of paying tuition), it is reasonable to assume that an eventual graduate union at MIT would represent at least 5000 members.
This comes to a total dues paid of $1.98 M/yr to the national, and $0.90 M/yr per year to the local.

Currently, the financial assistance provided by the UE consists of a few full-time organizer employees (less than 5), and a promise for future legal support.  

Per Article 12 Section D of the UE national constitution, these field organizers are paid $1,185.16 per week. For 52 weeks and 5 organizers, this expense comes to $308,000. 

Per NLRB reporting, the total legal expenditures of the UE National Union in 2018 came to $2.27 M. 

<span style="font-size:xx-large;">** $0.1 M + $2.27 M < $2.8 M**</span>

Our total dues in our first year would be more than sufficient to cover the entirety of the UE's representational cost and the cost of their consultants.
For a union of our size, there is no need for this financial support.

##### The Magnitude of UE Income
Furthermore, we can compare the value of our dues to the national to the total amount of money they bring in from dues in a year.
Per their mandatory reporting to the Department of Labor, the UE National Headquarters brought in $4.35 M in dues.
As a point of comparison we also include this theoretical population of 5000 MIT students to the ~35000 members of the UE.

To emphasize, this is not our total dues but only the fraction we would send to national.
Clearly we are paying more to this union than our fair share.

##### Fiscal Responsibility
The UE has claimed that they could support us financially should further issues arise, such as docking of wages due to strikes.
Full compensation for strike pay would be $20/hour * 20 hours/day * 5000 people = $0.8 M/day.
Currently, the UE has minimal financial assets, totaling approximately $2.5 M.
This means that financing a grad student strike at 100% strike pay would exhaust all available assets in 3 days.
At a more moderate 20% strike pay (which would not be enough for students to pay for housing and other necessities), this would still only last 15 days.
Graduate student strikes at other institutions have lasted far longer, and we would be left completely unprotected.

The bottom line is, the UE cannot protect us in the event of a strike and that any strike funds which could support us would be made of almost entirely our own contributions.

Further enforcing this concern one can review the asset portfolio over the last 20 years.
One can see an obvious liquidation of assets as neccessary to keep the organization afloat.

These data reinforce the idea that the UE needs MIT financially far more than we need them and their connections.

#### Independence concerns
Something acknowleding the "locals are independent" but...

##### Policy
Joining the UE also commits us to their political platform.
Although the UE does not have political spending, they still hold a number of political views and [encourage their locals to support them as well](https://www.ueunion.org/ue-policy).  
Furhermore, joining the UE means you are blanketly agreeing to their policy, as specified in the National Constitution, “Obligations of Members” section. 


These policies include a number of opinions and endorsements which run directly counter to the values of MIT graduate students:
- [Their energy policy denounces nuclear power](https://www.ueunion.org/ue-policy/a-green-new-deal-for-people-and-the-planet)
- [Their defense policy denounces military and especially aerospace research](https://www.ueunion.org/ue-policy/for-peace-jobs-and-a-pro-worker-foreign-policy)
- [Their international policy denounces collaborations with US allies, including Israel and Japan](https://www.ueunion.org/ue-policy/for-peace-jobs-and-a-pro-worker-foreign-policy)


Additionally, this has been a major problem in the advertising of the union as seen by a lack of transparency of GSU reps in reporting these obligations. 

##### Voting Power
Many GSU reps have claimed that we would have the power as a local to advocate for policy more to our tastes.
However, this stems from a misunderstanding of the UE voting system.  

At the national convention, we would be limited to a maximum of 15 speaking delegates, while unions of only 30 members would still be eligible for a minimum of 3 (Article 22 Section F), this would significantly dilute our voice in discussions of policy.  

Furthermore, although we would vote with our full membership strength, due to rounding up of smaller unions in determining voting strength, we would likely be disproportionately underrepresented, receiving less than our proportional 15% of the national union membership.
The results presented here are a preliminary approximation using the limited data provided to the US Department of Labor.
