We, the creators of this website do not here take a stance on the need for or validity of a graduate student union at MIT.
**We maintain only that joining the UE as a local is a dangerous and unnecessary choice for MIT graduate students.**
It is our objective to convince other graduate students to rescind or simply not sign UE union cards.
Should you find the arguments presented here convincing you may rescind your union card by contacting a local rep directly.
Regardless of your stance on the matter we hope this website and its associated [mailing lists](https://domain.org/signup) provide an open and honest opportunity to discuss the value of joining the UE.

### Disclaimer
If you have signed a membership card with the UE (through the GSU), by discussing this website with others or participating in the mailing lists, you may be participating in [secession or raiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_raid) activities, as prohibited by Article 24, Section D of the UE national constitution.
This can result in a union trial and possible expulsion from the UE.
